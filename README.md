This repository contains files for the MADS Data Exploration semester workshop on creating pipelines.

It consists of two notebooks:

- Notebook 1 covers importing and preparing data.
- Notebook 2 covers creating an ABT and performing sanity checks on the data.

This workshop makes use of two data sets provided by the Dutch national statistics bureau CBS, namely data set 84493NED ("Inkomen van huishoudens; inkomensbestanddelen, huishoudenskenmerken" - household incomes) and 83676NED ("Bestedingen van huishoudens; bestedingscategorieÃ«n" - household expenses).
